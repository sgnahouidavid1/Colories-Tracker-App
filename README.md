## <ins> Colories-Tracker-App  </ins>
Final project for 330 COSC at Salisbury University that I built with a follow classmate in Java.

The application allows users to login/sign-up (Firebase Authentication) and track the amount of calories they consume on a daily basis. 
Users can search for specific food idea using the U.S Department of Agriculture FoodData Central Database.  
User data is also stored in a Firebase Database
